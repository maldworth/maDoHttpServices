maDoHttpServices Version 1.1
================

This library was created to allow access to various Todo (aka Getting Things Done) online services such as ToodleDo, RTM, Todoist. It is an unofficial implementation, and currently only supports ToodleDo (however others should be easily addable).

This initial commit was made by me (maldworth) m@maldworth.com, and hopefully will get contributions from others here at github.

Dependencies
============
If running on android, you'll only need joda-time-1.6.jar, as android SDK has httpcore and httpclient already included. Ideally, I'd like to get rid of the joda-time dependency, and just use java's built in datetime.

If running on windows you'll need:
apache-mime4j-0.6.jar
commons-codec-1.3.jar
commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
httpclient-4.0.jar
httpcore-4.0.1.jar
httpmime-4.0.jar
joda-time-1.6.jar

Change Log
==========
v1.1
-Revamped the authentication mechanism. Now expired tokens or improper keys will trigger reauthentication if possible.
-Fixed a Bug where Tasks.setNote(String) was called from Task, because each line in a task was interpreted individually by the SAX Parser.

Contributions
=============
-v1.1: A big thanks to Alan P. for finding the Tasks setNote bug.
